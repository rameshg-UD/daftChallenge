# 🎨 DAFT Package Challenge - Recreating the Scurvy DAGs

::: {.callout-important}
## 📊 Challenge Requirements In Section [Student Analysis Section](#student-analysis-section)
- Recreate all three scurvy DAGs using DAFT programming
- Optional: Demonstrate understanding of DAFT customization options

## The Problem: Mastering Probabilistic Graphical Models with DAFT

**Core Question:** How can we use the DAFT package to create visually appealing Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that tell a compelling data story?

**The Challenge:** You'll recreate three historical DAGs depicting the fascinating story of how we lost and rediscovered the cure to scurvy. This challenge teaches you to use DAFT for creating professional-quality probabilistic graphical models.

**Our Approach:** We'll work through the three different understandings of the scurvy data generating process, learning DAFT customization techniques while exploring a crucial moment in medical history.

## ⚠️ AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance → Awareness → Learning → Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## The Scurvy Story: A Data Science Tragedy

Scurvy was a devastating disease that affected sailors on long voyages. The cure was discovered in 1747, but due to a misunderstanding about the cause, the cure was lost for over 150 years. The story involves three different understandings of the data generating process:

1. **1747 Understanding:** Lemons prevent scurvy (correct but incomplete!)
2. **Misguided Belief:** Acid kills bacteria that causes scurvy (wrong!)
3. **1928 Understanding:** Vitamin C prevents scurvy (the real mechanism)



```{python}
## Environment Setup

# First, let's install the DAFT package and set up our environment:

#| label: setup-environment
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Install DAFT package (run this in terminal if not already installed)
# pip install 'daft-pgm'

import daft 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Set up plotting parameters for better quality
plt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 150
plt.rcParams['savefig.dpi'] = 300

print("DAFT package imported successfully!")
print("Ready to create beautiful DAGs!")
```

## 💡 Understanding DAFT

**DAFT (Directed Acyclic Factor Graphs Toolkit)** is a Python package for creating probabilistic graphical models. It's particularly useful for:

- Creating Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
- Visualizing causal relationships
- Communicating data generating processes
- Creating publication-quality figures

**Key DAFT Concepts:**

- **Nodes:** Represent variables or factors
- **Edges:** Show relationships between variables
- **Plates:** Indicate repeated structures
- **Styling:** Customize colors, shapes, and formatting

::: {.callout-tip title="Simplified Lind's Model: Lemons and Scurvy Prevention"}

 In 1747, Scottish naval surgeon James Lind conducted one of the earliest clinical experiments and discovered that lemons and oranges could prevent scurvy, though he did not fully understand why. This marked a crucial but incomplete understanding, as the true cause remained unknown.

```{python}
#| label: dag-1-1747
#| echo: false

# Create a new PGM (Directed Acyclic Graph)
pgm = daft.PGM(shape=[4, 2], origin=[0, 0])

# Add nodes with color fills (approximate oval shape by layout)
#pgm.add_node("lemons", r"Lemons", 1, 1, plot_params={"facecolor": "#FFD966"})
pgm.add_node("lemons", r"Lemons", 1, 1, aspect=1.8,fontsize= 7,plot_params={"facecolor": "#FFD966", "edgecolor": "#C49A00", "lw": 1,'alpha': 0.5})      # Lemon yellow
pgm.add_node("scurvy", "Scurvy", 3, 1, aspect=1.8,fontsize= 7, plot_params={"facecolor": "#A9D18E","edgecolor": "#38761D", "lw": 1,'alpha': 0.5})  # Healthy green
# Add directed edge
pgm.add_edge("lemons", "scurvy")

# Render the DAG
pgm.render()

# Add title
plt.title("The 1747 Understanding (Correct but Incomplete)",
          fontsize=8, fontweight="bold", color="#14A3C7")
plt.axis("equal")  # Helps make nodes appear more oval

plt.show()
```

::: {.callout-tip title="The Misguided Belief (Wrong Understanding)"}

Over the following centuries, a misguided belief took hold that scurvy was caused by bacteria and that acidic substances such as vinegar cured it by killing the supposed microbes. This misconception delayed proper treatment and prevention efforts.

```{python}
#| label: dag-2-misguided
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false


# Create a PGM object
pgm = daft.PGM(dpi=150, alternate_style="outer")


pgm.add_node("acid", r"Acid" , 1.5, 3, aspect = 2, fontsize= 7,scale = 0.8,
             plot_params={
                 'facecolor': 'lightblue', 
                 'edgecolor': 'dodgerblue', 
                 'linewidth': 1,
                 'alpha': 0.5,
             })
pgm.add_node("bacteria", "Bacteria \n Death", 3, 2, aspect = 2, fontsize= 7,scale = 1,
             plot_params={
                 'facecolor': 'pink', 
                 'edgecolor': 'crimson', 
                 'linewidth': 1,
                 'alpha': 0.5,
             })

pgm.add_node("scury", "Scurvy \n Prevention", 4.5, 1, aspect = 2, fontsize= 7,scale = 1.1,
             plot_params={
                 "facecolor": "#A9D18E",
                 "edgecolor": "#38761D",
                 'linewidth': 1,
                 'alpha': 0.5,
             })

pgm.add_edge("acid", "bacteria")
pgm.add_edge("bacteria", "scury")

pgm.render()
plt.title("Updated Bacterial Theory (Late 19th Century)",
          fontsize=8, fontweight="bold", color="#14A3C7",pad=20)
plt.axis("equal")  # Helps make nodes appear more oval
plt.show()

Finally, in 1928, scientists correctly identified vitamin C (ascorbic acid) as the essential nutrient whose deficiency leads to scurvy. This discovery revealed the true biochemical mechanism behind the disease and permanently resolved the mystery that had confounded medicine for nearly two centuries.

```{python}
#| label: dag-3-modern
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false


pgm = daft.PGM(dpi=150, alternate_style="outer")

# Example of a professionally styled node
pgm.add_node("vitamin", "Vitamin \n C" , 1.5, 3, aspect = 2, fontsize= 7,scale = 1,
             plot_params={
                 'facecolor': 'lightblue', 
                 'edgecolor': 'dodgerblue', 
                 'linewidth': 1,
                 'alpha': 0.5,
             })

                 'linewidth': 1,
                 'alpha': 0.5,
             })

pgm.add_node("scury", "Scurvy \n Prevention", 4.5, 1, aspect = 2, fontsize= 7,scale = 1.1,
             plot_params={
                 "facecolor": "#A9D18E",
                 "edgecolor": "#38761D",
                'linewidth': 1,
                 'alpha': 0.5,
             })

pgm.add_edge("vitamin", "collagen")
